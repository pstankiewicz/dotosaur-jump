Tagline
=======

Remember this tiny game in Google Chrome, when you are lack of internet connection? You are a Dinosaur and you have to jump over obstacles.
Well - meet the Dotosaur jumping over sticks on your C64 :). Just use space and jump over those nasty sticks man!

And remember to play only when you are lack of internet connection on your trusty C64 ;).

Running game
============

On real metal
-------------

Transfer d64 file to floppy, or mount it using SD2IEC/Ultimate1541 solution, and load DOTO.MIN (tenliner) or DOTO.FULL (commented manyliner). Then just run it.

On emulator
-----------

Please - who needs emulators? But just in case - follow your emulator manual. In vice it will be mounting d64 file and (same as on real thing) loading DOTO.FULL or DOTO.MIN file, and running it.

Playing the game
================

Just hit space and jump. Nothing fancy here. Except that level changes sometimes, and difficulty rises. Good luck!
